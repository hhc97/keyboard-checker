This is an archive of [https://keyboardchecker.com/](https://keyboardchecker.com/). (without the ads)

I made this because I like the site, and I want to have a copy of it in case it ever goes down. The copy stored in this repo only depends on jquery and some fonts from Google.

You can access this repo's version of the site at: [https://hhc97.github.io/keyboard-checker/](https://hhc97.github.io/keyboard-checker/).

The site helps you check the functionality of your keyboard, and looks like this:
